This website no longer has a blog associated with it.
I have written blog posts at various points in my life, but I was never very good at
keeping backups, and I don't think I ever wrote much that I'm sad to lose.
So this will likely be one of very few posts that ever shows up here.
I might announce new publications here once in a blue moon.

My [non-academic website](https://scmb.xyz/) has a blog that might see more action, but don't count on it.
